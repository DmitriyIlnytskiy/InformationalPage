        <h2>Advancing Materials</h2>
        <div class="text-area-3">
            <p>Asphalt and concrete have been mainstays in the construction industry for as long as any of us have been alive. This doesn’t mean they cannot be improved, tweaked, and customized for each use. With 1,450 operating locations in North America, CRH’s Americas Materials businesses have the capacity to help advance our industry, and Texas Materials has access to this expertise. If you’re looking for “asphalt near me” then you will have no problem finding us somewhere in the Lone Star State!
                We also develop asphalt products here in Texas, designed to suit our particular climate and traffic conditions.
